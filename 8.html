                        Career
                        Planning should begin long before you take the first step towards your career. High school is
                        probably the best time to excavate, discover and analyze what you wish to become. <br><br>

                        This is the right age to make some initial plans and start working in the direction of what you
                        want to grow up as. It’s absolutely alright to change your mind multiple times, but what’s vital
                        is to start taking baby steps in the right path. The steering wheel of your career is in your
                        hands and strategizing it properly can help you to steer in the direction you want to move in.
                        Therefore following these five career planning tips is a must:</b> <br><br>

                        <b> Tip 1: Learn about Yourself</b> <br>
                        The primary step is to discover who you really are. Figuring out what you are good at is a must
                        for career planning. What you enjoy doing? Which things tend to make you happier? Which subjects
                        do you love the most? Which activities take your undivided attention such that you don’t even
                        notice how much time has passed? This is absolutely the right time to think about what you love!
                        <br>
                        Make a summary of what is important to you and what will contribute more to your personal
                        satisfaction. The more you know about your capabilities, skills, and competencies the more
                        effective you will be in making career choices. Learning about yourself is one of the most
                        important career planning tips and defines what exactly a student wants from their life.
                        <br><br>
                        <b>Tip 2: Look for options</b><br>
                        Once you have analyzed your preferred interests, skills and values, the next step is the quest
                        of those career options that fit in with your area of interest. If you love playing with
                        numbers, then you might be interested in the range of careers from statisticians to stockbrokers
                        to an economist. This is the second most important career planning tips as it helps you identify
                        all the possible career options available for you.
                        <br>
                        Take time to explore all the possible careers, however different they might be. You never know
                        what may appear dreary at first, might seem appealing once you start exploring it! Remember you
                        need not rush into any decision but all you need is to keep an open mind.
                        <br><br>
                        <b>Tip 3: Research well</b><br>
                        The next step in this career quest is to start enquiring about the careers you wish to explore.
                        Neither follow any assumptions nor go by what others may say! The wise step is to extend out and
                        gather every tiny bit of concrete information possible – from routine tasks and duties to
                        working conditions, from skills needed to salary range, from career trends to employment
                        outlook.
                        <br>
                        Find out what credit analysts and anthropologists really do? Also, try to get in touch with the
                        professionals of those fields to catch some behind the scene action. When you research well you
                        become a one-stop source to all the things you would require in career planning.
                        <br><br>
                        <b>Tip 4: Keep in touch with sports</b><br>
                        Participating in extracurricular activities may glimmer some career interests. From debating to
                        sports to cultural programs, try your hand at every possible thing. Exploring different
                        activities will help you in discovering your likes and dislikes and in gaining a better
                        understanding of yourself thus ensuring effective career choices. You will get to hone many
                        valuable skills like leadership qualities, volunteering, time management, and decision making.
                        <br><br>
                        <b>Tip 5: Keep exploring</b><br>
                        Why restricting your knowledge to books? Try and get some taste of work. Getting hands-on
                        experience is another step in helping you to figure out what you like and whatnot. We understand
                        you cannot pick up full-time jobs but one can opt for summer internships or part-time
                        employment. Remember one thing that grades come first so this is for the students who can manage
                        their schedule and time well with studies.</p>
